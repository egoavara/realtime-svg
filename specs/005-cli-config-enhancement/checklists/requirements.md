# Specification Quality Checklist: CLI Configuration Enhancement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-18  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review
- ✅ Spec explicitly mentions using clap, figment, and dotenvy in requirements FR-001 through FR-003, but these are the **user's explicit technical constraints** from the input description. The spec focuses on WHAT the system should do (configuration hierarchy, file loading, validation) rather than HOW to implement it beyond the user's specified tool choices.
- ✅ User scenarios are written from operator perspective focusing on configuration management workflows.
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete.

### Requirement Completeness Review
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present.
- ✅ All 12 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-005 can be tested by setting same value in all three sources).
- ✅ Success criteria use measurable metrics (time-based: SC-001 "30초 이내", percentage-based: SC-004 "90% 이상").
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on operator experience, not system internals).
- ✅ Each user story includes specific acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format.
- ✅ Edge cases section identifies 6 boundary conditions.
- ✅ Scope is bounded with "Out of Scope" section (encryption, hot reload, etc.).
- ✅ Assumptions section documents 6 specific assumptions about behavior.

### Feature Readiness Review
- ✅ Functional requirements map to user scenarios (e.g., FR-004 supports User Story 4).
- ✅ User scenarios cover all primary flows (file-based, env-based, CLI-based, custom path, help).
- ✅ Success criteria define clear outcomes for operators (SC-001 through SC-006).
- ✅ Spec maintains focus on configuration management behavior without leaking implementation beyond user's specified constraints.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

Note: The mention of clap, figment, and dotenvy in the requirements is intentional as these were **explicit user constraints** in the feature description, not implementation details introduced by the spec writer.
